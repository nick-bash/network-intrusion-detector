------ A network intrusion detector built using deep learning  ------

Hi there - I built a deep learning algorithm to classify network activity as benign or malicious using network flows from .pcap files.

This project was for my Deep Learning class at Stanford with Professor Andrew Ng.

Reach out with any questions or comments!
