------ A network intrusion detector built using deep learning  ------

Hi there - I built a deep learning algorithm to classify network activity as benign or malicious using network flows from .pcap files.

This small project was for my Deep Learning class at Stanford with Professor Andrew Ng.

Many thanks to the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity for making the CICIDS-2017 dataset available!
